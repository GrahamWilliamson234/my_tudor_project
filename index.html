        <h2>King Henry VII</h2>
        <h5>Reign: 1485 - 1509</h5>
        <p>History of the Reign of King Henry VII. 
            Henry VII was King of England and Lord of Ireland from his seizure of the crown 
            on 22 August 1485 until his death in 1509. He was the first monarch of 
            the House of Tudor. Henry's mother, Margaret Beaufort, was a descendant 
            of the Lancastrian branch of the House of Plantagenet. Henry's father, 
            Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond, a half-brother of Henry VI of England 
            and a member of the Welsh Tudors of Penmynydd, died three months before 
            his son Henry was born. During Henry's early years, his uncle Henry VI was 
            fighting against Edward IV, a member of the Yorkist Plantagenet branch. 
            After Edward retook the throne in 1471, Henry Tudor spent 14 years in 
            exile in Brittany. He attained the throne when his forces, supported by 
            France, Scotland, and Wales, defeated Edward IV's brother Richard III at 
            the Battle of Bosworth Field, the culmination of the Wars of the Roses. 
            He was the last king of England to win his throne on the field of battle. 
            He cemented his claim by marrying Elizabeth of York, daughter of King Edward IV.
            Henry restored power and stability to the English monarchy following the civil war. 
            He is credited with many administrative, economic and diplomatic initiatives. 
            His supportive policy toward England's wool industry and his standoff with the 
            Low Countries had long-lasting benefit to the English economy. He paid very close 
            attention to detail, and instead of spending lavishly he concentrated on raising 
            new revenues. He stabilised the government's finances by introducing several new 
            taxes. After his death, a commission found widespread abuses in the tax collection
             process. Henry reigned for nearly 24 years and was peacefully succeeded by his son, Henry VIII.

            <h2>King Henry VIII</h2>
            <h5>Reign: 1509 - 1547</h5>
            <p>Henry VIII ruled England for 36 years, presiding over sweeping 
             changes that brought his nation into the Protestant Reformation. He 
             famously married a series of six wives in his search for political 
             alliance, marital bliss and a healthy male heir. His desire to annul 
             his first marriage without papal approval led to the creation of a 
             separate Church of England. Of his marriages, two ended in annulment, 
             two in natural deaths and two with his wives’ beheadings for adultery
              and treason. His children Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I would each 
              take their turn as England’s monarch. Henry was an extravagant spender, 
              using the proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries and acts of 
              the Reformation Parliament. He also converted the money that was formerly 
              paid to Rome into royal revenue. Despite the money from these sources, 
              he was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal 
              extravagance, as well as his numerous costly and largely unsuccessful 
              wars, particularly with King Francis I of France, Holy Roman Emperor 
              Charles V, King James V of Scotland and the Scottish regency under the 
              Earl of Arran and Mary of Guise. At home, he oversaw the legal union of 
              England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 and was the 
              first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland following the Crown of 
              Ireland Act 1542.

        <h2>King Edward VI</h2>
        <h5>Reign: 1547 - 1553</h5>
        <p>On January 28, 1547, Henry VIII died, and Edward, then age nine, succeeded to the throne.
          Henry had decreed that during Edward’s minority the government was to be run by a council of regency,
           but in fact Edward’s uncle, Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, wielded almost supreme power as regent, 
           with the title of protector. Factions soon developed around the king. In 1549 Somerset was overthrown
            by the unscrupulous John Dudley, earl of Warwick (soon to be duke of Northumberland). Northumberland 
            put Edward forward at the age of 14 as entitled to all the power of Henry VIII, but the young king was
             the mask behind which Northumberland controlled the government. The measures taken by both Somerset and
              Northumberland to consolidate the English Reformation, however, agreed with Edward’s own intense devotion to Protestantism.

        <h2>Queen Mary I</h2>
        <h5>Reign: 1553 - 1558</h5>
        <p>England’s first female monarch, Mary I (1516-1558) ruled for just five years.
          The only surviving child of Henry VIII and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon,
           Mary took the throne after the brief reign of her half-brother, Edward VI.
            She sought to return England to the Catholic Church and stirred rebellions 
            by marrying a Spanish Habsburg prince. But she is most remembered for burning 
            nearly 300 English Protestants at the stake for heresy, which earned her the 
            nickname “Bloody Mary”. Mary was the only child of Henry VIII by his first wife, 
            Catherine of Aragon, to survive to adulthood. Her younger half-brother, Edward VI, 
            succeeded their father in 1547 at the age of nine. When Edward became mortally ill 
            in 1553, he attempted to remove Mary from the line of succession because he supposed, 
            correctly, that she would reverse the Protestant reforms that had taken place during 
            his reign. Upon his death, leading politicians proclaimed Lady Jane Grey as queen. 
            Mary speedily assembled a force in East Anglia and deposed Jane, who was ultimately 
            beheaded. Mary was—excluding the disputed reigns of Jane and the Empress Matilda—the 
            first queen regnant of England. In July 1554, Mary married Philip of Spain, becoming 
            queen consort of Habsburg Spain on his accession in January 1556. After Mary's death in 1558, 
            her re-establishment of Roman Catholicism was reversed by her younger half-sister and successor, 
            Elizabeth I.

        <h2>Queen Elizabeth I</h2>
        <h5>Reign: 1558 - 1603</h5>
        <p>Elizabeth I, bynames the Virgin Queen and Good Queen Bess, 
            (born September 7, 1533, Greenwich, near London, England—died March 24, 1603,
             Richmond, Surrey), queen of England (1558–1603) during a period, often 
             called the Elizabethan Age, when England asserted itself vigorously as a 
             major European power in politics, commerce, and the arts.
         </p>
         <p>
            Although her small kingdom was threatened by grave internal divisions,
             Elizabeth’s blend of shrewdness, courage, and majestic self-display 
             inspired ardent expressions of loyalty and helped unify the nation
             against foreign enemies. The adulation bestowed upon her both in her
             lifetime and in the ensuing centuries was not altogether a spontaneous
             effusion. It was the result of a carefully crafted, brilliantly
             executed campaign in which the queen fashioned herself as the 
             glittering symbol of the nation’s destiny. This political symbolism,
             common to monarchies, had more substance than usual, for the queen 
             was by no means a mere figurehead. While she did not wield the
             absolute power of which Renaissance rulers dreamed, she tenaciously
             upheld her authority to make critical decisions and to set the 
             central policies of both state and church. The latter half of the 
             16th century in England is justly called the Elizabethan Age: rarely
             has the collective life of a whole era been given so distinctively
             personal a stamp.
