        <h2>King Henry VII</h2>
        <h5>Reign: 1485 - 1509</h5>
        <p>History of the Reign of King Henry VII. 
            Henry VII was King of England and Lord of Ireland from his seizure of the crown 
            on 22 August 1485 until his death in 1509. He was the first monarch of 
            the House of Tudor. Henry's mother, Margaret Beaufort, was a descendant 
            of the Lancastrian branch of the House of Plantagenet. Henry's father, 
            Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond, a half-brother of Henry VI of England 
            and a member of the Welsh Tudors of Penmynydd, died three months before 
            his son Henry was born. During Henry's early years, his uncle Henry VI was 
            fighting against Edward IV, a member of the Yorkist Plantagenet branch. 
            After Edward retook the throne in 1471, Henry Tudor spent 14 years in 
            exile in Brittany. He attained the throne when his forces, supported by 
            France, Scotland, and Wales, defeated Edward IV's brother Richard III at 
            the Battle of Bosworth Field, the culmination of the Wars of the Roses. 
            He was the last king of England to win his throne on the field of battle. 
            He cemented his claim by marrying Elizabeth of York, daughter of King Edward IV.
            Henry restored power and stability to the English monarchy following the civil war. 
            He is credited with many administrative, economic and diplomatic initiatives. 
            His supportive policy toward England's wool industry and his standoff with the 
            Low Countries had long-lasting benefit to the English economy. He paid very close 
            attention to detail, and instead of spending lavishly he concentrated on raising 
            new revenues. He stabilised the government's finances by introducing several new 
            taxes. After his death, a commission found widespread abuses in the tax collection
             process. Henry reigned for nearly 24 years and was peacefully succeeded by his son, Henry VIII.
