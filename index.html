        <h2>King Henry VII</h2>
        <h5>Reign: 1485 - 1509</h5>
        <p>History of the Reign of King Henry VII. 
            Henry VII was King of England and Lord of Ireland from his seizure of the crown 
            on 22 August 1485 until his death in 1509. He was the first monarch of 
            the House of Tudor. Henry's mother, Margaret Beaufort, was a descendant 
            of the Lancastrian branch of the House of Plantagenet. Henry's father, 
            Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond, a half-brother of Henry VI of England 
            and a member of the Welsh Tudors of Penmynydd, died three months before 
            his son Henry was born. During Henry's early years, his uncle Henry VI was 
            fighting against Edward IV, a member of the Yorkist Plantagenet branch. 
            After Edward retook the throne in 1471, Henry Tudor spent 14 years in 
            exile in Brittany. He attained the throne when his forces, supported by 
            France, Scotland, and Wales, defeated Edward IV's brother Richard III at 
            the Battle of Bosworth Field, the culmination of the Wars of the Roses. 
            He was the last king of England to win his throne on the field of battle. 
            He cemented his claim by marrying Elizabeth of York, daughter of King Edward IV.
            Henry restored power and stability to the English monarchy following the civil war. 
            He is credited with many administrative, economic and diplomatic initiatives. 
            His supportive policy toward England's wool industry and his standoff with the 
            Low Countries had long-lasting benefit to the English economy. He paid very close 
            attention to detail, and instead of spending lavishly he concentrated on raising 
            new revenues. He stabilised the government's finances by introducing several new 
            taxes. After his death, a commission found widespread abuses in the tax collection
             process. Henry reigned for nearly 24 years and was peacefully succeeded by his son, Henry VIII.

            <h2>King Henry VIII</h2>
            <h5>Reign: 1509 - 1547</h5>
            <p>Henry VIII ruled England for 36 years, presiding over sweeping 
             changes that brought his nation into the Protestant Reformation. He 
             famously married a series of six wives in his search for political 
             alliance, marital bliss and a healthy male heir. His desire to annul 
             his first marriage without papal approval led to the creation of a 
             separate Church of England. Of his marriages, two ended in annulment, 
             two in natural deaths and two with his wives’ beheadings for adultery
              and treason. His children Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I would each 
              take their turn as England’s monarch. Henry was an extravagant spender, 
              using the proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries and acts of 
              the Reformation Parliament. He also converted the money that was formerly 
              paid to Rome into royal revenue. Despite the money from these sources, 
              he was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal 
              extravagance, as well as his numerous costly and largely unsuccessful 
              wars, particularly with King Francis I of France, Holy Roman Emperor 
              Charles V, King James V of Scotland and the Scottish regency under the 
              Earl of Arran and Mary of Guise. At home, he oversaw the legal union of 
              England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 and was the 
              first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland following the Crown of 
              Ireland Act 1542.
