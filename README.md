# [My Project 1](http://project1.dazl.ie)

Hi! My name is Graham. In this README page were you will find out a little about me, my website, my coding journey, my projects and who has influenced me in the development of this website.

I am very new to coding and this will be one of my first real projects, during this project I met many walls I needed to climb. As with any project thinking of an idea of which to base it on, can be one of the hardest parts and this was no exception. As a history buff I decided to base within this field.
